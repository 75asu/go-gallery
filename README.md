This repo holds all the Go projects I have built, few on my own, few from tutorials.

1. [goredis](https://github.com/measutosh/goredis) - in memory database similar to redis 
2. [peering-http-server](https://github.com/measutosh/peering-http-server) - a server that can ping to other servers in a cluster to check heartbeat
